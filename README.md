# LumeSpace: Solving Space Problems Through Open-Source 🚀✨

> "Solving orbital network problems saves countless lives and accelerates our progress as a species."

LumeSpace is a dedicated workspace for prototyping and open-sourcing solutions to modern space challenges. Our mission is to combine cutting-edge web technologies (Cloudflare, Astro, Three.js) with aerospace engineering principles to build tools that matter.

## 🌌 The Mission Log (Future Ideas)

This repository serves as a hub for various space-related prototypes. Below are the core ideas we aim to explore:

### 1. AegisLink: Orbital Network Simulator 🌐🛰️

**Tech**: Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects
Imitate the behavior of satellites or aircraft using a distributed global network.

- **Latency Emulation**: Use Cloudflare's edge to inject latency based on speed-of-light calculations for orbital nodes.
- **Global Mesh State**: Use Durable Objects to handle state for individual satellites as they move through different "ground station" jurisdictions.
- **Protocol Testing**: Build a sandbox for testing how data moves through a moving orbital mesh.

### 2. Lifeline Mesh: Low-Latency Humanitarian Protocol 🚑📡

**Goal**: Save lives in disaster zones by optimizing "time-to-first-ping".

- Prioritize SOS and coordination packets in high-latency orbital environments.
- Research faster routing algorithms for LEO constellations.

### 3. Orbital Light Guide 🔭✨

**Impact**: Help astronomers and the public coexist with satellite constellations.

- Predict satellite trails and "flares" to preserve the night sky for photography and science.

### 4. LunaGrid: Moon Base Survival Sim 🌑🔋

**Goal**: Solve the "Lunar Night" power problem.

- A simulation sandbox for designing resilient lunar power grids (Solar + Battery + Nuclear).

### 5. SWS: Space-Waste Schema 🗑️

**Goal**: Standardize how we track "junk".

- An open-source JSON protocol for reporting and sharing space debris data across agencies.
