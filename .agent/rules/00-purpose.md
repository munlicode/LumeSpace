# Purpose & Core Vision 🌌

The fundamental "Why" of the LumeSpace project.

## 🚀 The North Star

LumeSpace exists to solve complex space-related problems through open-source software. We believe that improving orbital infrastructure and humanitarian technology is essential for the future of humanity.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

1.  **Life-Saving Innovation**: Prioritize low-latency protocols and emergency networking for disaster relief.
2.  **Scientific Accessibility**: Make deep space and orbital data digestible for the public and the scientific community.
3.  **Prototyping Excellence**: Build modular, high-performance prototypes that can be easily extended by the community.

## 🕊️ Open Source Ethos

Everything we build must be open, transparent, and licensed under Apache 2.0 to ensure maximum impact and freedom.
