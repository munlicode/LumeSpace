# Design & Code Style 🎨

Aesthetics and technical standards for a premium engineering experience.

## ✨ Visual Excellence (The "Wow" Factor)

All UI-facing prototypes must feel premium and state-of-the-art:

- **Rich Aesthetics**: Use vibrant colors, dark modes, and modern typography (Google Fonts like Inter or Outfit).
- **Dynamic Feedback**: Implement smooth micro-animations and hover effects (Framer Motion / Vanilla Transitions).
- **No Placeholders**: Use real data or generated assets; avoid generic states.

## 💻 Code Principles

- **Clean & Modular**: Prioritize readability over cleverness. If a component is > 100 lines, consider breaking it down.
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript by default. Define strict interfaces for orbital data and networking protocols.
- **Performance First**: Since we simulate speed-of-light latency, our code must not add unnecessary terrestrial overhead.

## 🛠 Tooling

- **Prettier**: Consistent formatting is mandatory.
- **Turbo**: Always leverage task caching for fast builds.
